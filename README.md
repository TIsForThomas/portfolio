# portfolio-project-1

#### By Stephen "Thomas" Nelson

## What is it?

This project required me to create my first iteration of my portfolio page with just html and css.

## What did I do?

From the ground up I created element seen on the page excluding the images.

## Why not use and API?

Fundementals are important, my idea for this project was to put together a colorful, functional website without the use of an API so that I could demonstrate my skills with html and css.
